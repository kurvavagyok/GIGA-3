# Concepts and Guides [\#](https://training-api.cerebras.ai/en/latest/wsc/\#concepts-and-guides "Permalink to this headline")

Here we provide you with a comprehensive guide for all things Cerebras. You’ll find detailed information on our core concepts, workflows, features, and the Cerebras PyTorch API. Explore the Cerebras Model Zoo with its pre-configured Large Language Models (LLM), Computer Vision (CV) models, and multimodal support for models like LLaVA, or bring your own PyTorch ML model and dataset.

The [Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster](https://training-api.cerebras.ai/en/latest/wsc/Concepts/how-cerebras-works.html#network-attached-accelerator) is meticulously engineered to enable the training of neural networks with remarkably efficient linear scaling across millions of cores, all without the complexities of traditional distributed computing. This portal includes set-up guides for establishing a Cerebras virtual environment and using the Cerebras Model Zoo. You’ll also find step-by-step tutorials and how-to guides covering every aspect in detail.
